## Gotchas
* Every chain should terminate with an empty `()`. Execution will only commence after that.
* With streamy, `foreach` **do not** terminate chaining. You can chain multiple `foreach` blocks or even add a `reduce` block after a `foreach`. This will not modify the data.
* Unlike native function, which usually have a function signature similar to `(..., element, index, array..)`, streamy functions will not provide an `array`. It will however provide ` element, index` parameters. The `index` provided is calculated to match the index of a virtual array that the previous operations could have generated. In other words, `element` and `index` are exactly the same as what you'd get when using native array operations
